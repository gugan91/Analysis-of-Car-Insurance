# Analysis-of-Car-Insurance
 - Analyzed the key features, performed EDA using Python and it's libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
 - Applied, tested, and compared machine learning models Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Bagging Classifier, K-Neighbours Classifier, Random Forest, SVM Classifier, Guassiannb Classifier, Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting. Performed hyperparameter tuning for all models and Extreme Gradient Boosting was the highest among all the trained models with an accuracy of 84.3%.
